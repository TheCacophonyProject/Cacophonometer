The Bird Monitor is the easiest way to measure how bird populations are changing. This device makes periodic sound recordings and uploads them to the cloud, noting the time and location. These recordings will be analysed to detect the volume of birdsong and how it changes over time, giving you an objective measure of the impact of predator control or reforestation.
